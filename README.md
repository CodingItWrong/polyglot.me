Consistent cheat sheets for multiple programming languages.


Adding Tools or Features
========================

The list of features and tools (i.e. programming languages or
frameworks) is driven from a set of JSON files in the 'data' folder. To
add or modify a feature or tool, fork this repository, make the
appropriate changes, and submit a pull request.

**Please use hard tabs, not spaces, when adding entries to the JSON
file, just to keep things consistent.**

- [Submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)


Private Installations
=====================

Feel free to make a private fork for internal use within your
organization. For example, you may want to include just the languages
and libraries and versions you use, add proprietary frameworks, or modify
features to match your coding standards. All I ask is that, if you make
any additions to publicly-available tools, please do a pull request to
add them to the master.


Installing
==========

To run, clone the repository, then run `npm install`. The application
must be run within a web server that supports .htaccess files and
rewriting, and it must be installed at the root level of its domain.

If you do not yet have npm installed, get it here: http://nodejs.org/
